MyBrary is an application that I developed to help someone keep track of their own personal reading goals.  So far the database 
tracks of the progress the user has made while reading the book.  The user is able to modify their own library by making 
any necessary changes such as modifying the title, their progression, the author, and the total amount of pages within the book.
